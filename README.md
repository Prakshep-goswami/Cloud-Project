# Cloud-Project Hypervisor


A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), is a software layer that allows multiple operating systems to run concurrently on a single physical machine (host). It does this by abstracting the physical hardware, creating isolated virtual machines (VMs) that share the host's resources. This enables efficient utilization of computing resources and supports various operating systems and applications on the same hardware. 
Key functions of a hypervisor:
Resource Management:
Allocates and manages resources like CPU, memory, and storage among the guest VMs. 
Isolation:
Ensures that each VM operates independently, preventing one VM's issues from affecting others. 
Virtualization:
Creates virtual representations of the physical hardware, allowing VMs to run without direct access to the host's hardware. 
Scheduling:
Schedules the execution of VMs on the host's resources, ensuring fair and efficient utilization. 
Types of Hypervisors:
Type 1 (Bare-metal):
Runs directly on the host's hardware, acting as an operating system itself (e.g., VMware ESXi, Xen, KVM).
Type 2 (Hosted):
Runs as a software layer on top of an existing operating system (e.g., VMware Workstation, Oracle VM VirtualBox). 
Benefits of using hypervisors:
Increased Resource Utilization:
Optimizes the use of physical hardware by running multiple VMs on a single server. 
Improved Efficiency:
Reduces the need for separate physical servers, leading to cost savings and simplified management. 
Enhanced Flexibility:
Allows for easy creation, deployment, and management of VMs, enabling dynamic allocation of resources. 
Disaster Recovery:
Supports VM replication and failover mechanisms, ensuring business continuity.
